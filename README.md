# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
* Purpose of the analysis is to find the best possible combination of Theater Launch Date and Play's fundraising goal for Louise's play *Fever*. By performing the analysis from the data provided, it is apparent from the graphs that the best combination of Theater Launch Date and Fundraising Goal would be between the months of May and July with a fundraising goal of less than $5000. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* The Analysis of The Launch Date was performed by creating a pivot table with *Outcomes* in Columns, *Date Created Conversion* as Rows, and *Parent Category & Years* as the Filters. The Table filtered out the data to show only Theater as the category, and the following graph can be generated from the data.

* As a conclusion, the months of May, June, and July are the best months as theater launch dates, with May being the month with the most successful Launch Dates. Thus, from this analysis, it is recommended that Louise should launch the play during the three summer months.
