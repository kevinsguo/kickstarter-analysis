# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
* Purpose of the analysis is to find the best possible combination of Theater Launch Date and Play's fundraising goal for Louise's play *Fever*. By performing the analysis from the data provided, it is apparent from the graphs that the best combination of Theater Launch Date and Fundraising Goal would be between the months of May and July with a fundraising goal of less than 5000. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* The Analysis of The Launch Date was performed by creating a pivot table with *Outcomes* in Columns, *Date Created Conversion* as Rows, and *Parent Category & Years* as the Filters. The Table filtered out the data to show only Theater as the category, and the following graph can be generated from the data.

* As a conclusion, the months of May, June, and July are the best months as theater launch dates, with May being the month with the most successful Launch Dates. Thus, from this analysis, it is recommended that Louise should launch the play during the three summer months. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
* The Analysis of Outcomes was performed by gathering data from three criterias, *Goal*, *Outcome* (Successful,Failed,or Canceled), and *Play* as the category. The following graph was plotted from the findings.

* From this graph, it can be concluded that a fundraising Goal of less than 5000 would have the highest Successful Percentage. Though a Goal of 35000 to 45000 also shows a similar percentage of success and fails as less than 5000, but the Total Projects recorded between 35000 to 45000 fundraising goal is only 9, compared to 720 Total Projects recorded for less than 5000. With such a small sample size, the data should not be used as a reliable source of comparison. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
